                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <h5>What shoes should I wear?</h5>
                <p>Ladies and  gents, be warned – we will be on grass and gravel, so leave the stilettos in the city or be prepared to get <em>~tipsy~</em>.</p>

                <h5>Do I need to attend all three events?</h5>
                <p>Not at all! Saturday is the main event that you won't want to miss. Friday welcome drinks, and the Sunday brunch will be casual and completely optional, but we'd love to see you there.</p>

                <h5>Will we be indoors or outdoors on Saturday?</h5>
                <p>The ceremony and cocktail hour will be on the lawn, and the reception will be under a tent.</p>

                <h5>What do I need to cross the border into the USA ?</h5>
                <p>You will need a valid passport! If you are borrowing a car, consider bringing a signed note from the owner. If you're borrowing a child, same deal (bring a note from the parent). If you are bringing pets, remember their up-to-date rabies vaccination records.</p>

                <h5>Who can help me with last-minute questions?</h5>
                <p>Not us! Our wonderful wedding planner Katharine will be available for any day-of questions or quandaries. She can be reached at (716) 474–3318.</p>
